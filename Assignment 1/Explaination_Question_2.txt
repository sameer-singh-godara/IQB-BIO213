The Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment, which is often used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences:

1. The function sw(x, y, match=2, mismatch=-1, gap=-3) is defined, where x and y are the sequences to be aligned, and match, mismatch, and gap are the scores for match, mismatch, and gap, respectively.

2. The function initializes two matrices, F and P. F is the scoring matrix, and P is the pointer matrix used to trace back the optimal alignment.

3. The function then fills the matrices using a nested loop. For each cell in the matrix, it calculates the score for match/mismatch (a1), deletion (a2), and insertion (a3), and assigns the maximum of these scores to the cell. It also updates the pointer matrix accordingly.

4. If the score at a cell is greater than the current maximum score, it updates the maximum score and the position of this score. If the score is equal to the maximum score, it adds the position to the list of maximum positions.

5. After filling the matrices, it prints the scoring matrix using pandas DataFrame for better visualization.

6. The function then performs the traceback to find all optimal local alignments. It does this iteratively using a stack to avoid recursion. For each maximum position, it starts a traceback until it reaches a cell with a score of 0. During the traceback, it builds the alignment by adding characters or gaps to the sequences.

7. Finally, it prints all optimal local alignments and their scores.

8. The function is then called with two sequences, "GATGCGCAG" and "GGCAGTA", as arguments.
