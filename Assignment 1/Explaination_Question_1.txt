The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment, which is often used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences.

1. The function nw(x, y, match=2, mismatch=-3, gap=-1) is defined, where x and y are the sequences to be aligned, and match, mismatch, and gap are the scores for match, mismatch, and gap, respectively.

2. The function initializes two matrices, F and P. F is the scoring matrix, and P is the pointer matrix used to trace back the optimal alignment.

3. The function then fills the matrices using a nested loop. For each cell in the matrix, it calculates the score for match/mismatch (a1), deletion (a2), and insertion (a3), and assigns the maximum of these scores to the cell. It also updates the pointer matrix accordingly.

4. After filling the matrices, it prints the scoring matrix using pandas DataFrame for better visualization.

5. The function then performs the traceback to find all optimal global alignments. It does this iteratively using a stack to avoid recursion. For each cell in the matrix, it starts a traceback until it reaches the top-left cell. During the traceback, it builds the alignment by adding characters or gaps to the sequences.

6. Finally, it prints all optimal global alignments and their scores.

7. The function is then called with two sequences, "GATGCGCAG" and "GGCAGTA", as arguments.
